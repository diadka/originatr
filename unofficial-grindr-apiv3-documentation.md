#Unofficial Grindr API v3 documentation

Grindr's service is comprised of:
  1. A REST API endpoint, at https://grindr.mobi
  2. A regular HTTP CDN, at http://cdns.grindr.com
  3. An XMPP server at chat.grindr.com:5222

All API calls to the REST endpoint must be sent with the HTTP user-agent set to something like `grindr3/3.0.1.4529;4529;Unknown;Android 4.4.4`.
The REST endpoint will fail requests with HTTP/412 if it doesn't like the user-agent.

##Updating dynamic configuration
Some configuration is pulled from the server, presumably so Grindr can change it at any time.
In pratice, these don't seem to change often, so you can consider caching them.

###Service endpoints
The official app first downloads a list of service endpoints. 
Issue an unauthenticated GET request to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/bootstrap` to get a list of server names you'll use.
Example response:

    {
        "services": {
            "api": [
                {
                    "domain": "g3-beta.grindr.com",
                    "host": "g3-beta.grindr.com",
                    "port": 443,
                    "protocol": "https"
                }
            ],
            "authenticationWeb": [
                {
                    "host": "neo-account.grindr.com",
                    "path": "",
                    "port": 443,
                    "protocol": "https"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

###Managed fields
Certain enums and flags are downloaded from the server.
For example, the list of Ethnicities shown on a user's profile is a managed field.
Grindr can add a new Ethnicity at any time without a client update.

Issue an unauthenticated GET request to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/managed-fields` to get a list of fields.
Example response (partly redacted to conserve space):

    {
        "fields": {
            "lookingFor":[{"fieldId":2,"name":"Chat"},{"fieldId":3,"name":"Dates"}, . . . etc],
            "relationshipStatus":[{"fieldId":4,"name":"Committed"},{"fieldId":2,"name":"Dating"}, . . . etc],
            "bodyType":[{"fieldId":1,"name":"Toned"},{"fieldId":2,"name":"Average"}, . . . etc],
            "ethnicity":[{"fieldId":1,"name":"Asian"},{"fieldId":2,"name":"Black"}, . . . etc],
            "grindrTribes":[{"fieldId":1,"name":"Bear"},{"fieldId":2,"name":"Clean-Cut"},. . . etc],
            "reportReasons":[{"fieldId":1,"name":"Offensive profile image"},{"fieldId":2,"name":"Offensive profile text"}, . . . etc]
            }
    }

Most fields are self-explanatory elements on the profile.
The exception is `reportReasons`, which is used to report a policy violation to Grindr's moderators.

##Authentication
Terminology (not official, just used in this document):
- **Email**.  The "username" as far as the user is concerned.  It is just an email address.
- **Password**.  The password the user selected when creating the account.  The user types this in once during first setup, and probably forgets it immediately.
- **Profile Id**.  An integer that is the actual username.
- **Authentication Token**.  A persistent key that is stored on disk to allow signing in without needing to retype the password.
- **Session Id**.  A short-lived token that is used with each HTTP API call.
- **XMPP Token**.  A short-lived token that is used to log into the XMPP server.
- **GCM Token**.  A Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) token generated by calling [InstanceId.getToken](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/iid/InstanceID.html#getToken(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)).

###Creating a new account
Ask the user for the following information:
- Email address
- Password
- Birthday (for age verification, and presumably also better ad targeting)
- Whether the user would like to receive emails from Grindr's marketing department

Issue a POST request to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/users` with this payload:

    {
        "birthday": <timestamp>,
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "optIn": false,
        "password": "my cool password",
        "token": "<GCM Token; see description below>"
    }

Encode `birthday` as an integer holding a Unix timestamp multiplied by 1000 (i.e., Unix milliseconds).
Note that people who were born before 1970 will have a _negative_ birthday.
For example, someone born on 1 Jan 1923 00:00:00 UTC would have a birthday of `-1483228800000`. 

The `token` is the GCM Token used to authorize the app to deliver push notifications.
It appears to be validated by the server, so you'll have to find a way to get an authentic GCM authorization token.
Normally, an Android or iOS app can simply call InstanceID.getToken.
However, if your platform doesn't have a Google SDK, you're in trouble.

If there's an error creating the account, the server will return an HTTP 4xx error code.
For example, if the email account is already signed up for Grindr, the server returns HTTP/409 with this payload:

    {
        "code": 22,
        "message": "Email id already exists"
    }

(Unfortunately, this means you can easily out someone as a Grindr user, simply by knowing his email address.
This seems like a severe privacy problem.)

If account creation is successful, the server returns HTTP/201 (note not the usual 200) with this response:

    {
        "authToken": "<the Authentication Token>",
        "profileId": "<the Profile Id>",
        "sessionId": "<a Session Id for immediate use>",
        "xmppToken": "<an XMPP Token for immediate use>"
    }

Save the Email Address, Authentication Token, and Profile Id to disk.
The Authentication Token is a password equivalent, so store it securely.

You can use the Session Id and XMPP Token to immediately begin using the service.
You do not need to log in or create a new session; the server has conveniently created a session for you already.

###Logging into an existing account without an Authentication Token
If the account already exists, but you don't have an Authentication Token yet, you'll need to get an Authentication Token.
Typically, this would be the first time the user runs your app.

POST a request to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/sessions` with this payload:

    {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "password": "my cool password",
        "token": "<GCM Token; see discussion above>"
    }

If successful, the server returns the same response as in the previous section.

###Every subsequent session
Assuming you know the Authentication Token and Email Address, you'll just need to create a new session.
Issue a POST to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/sessions` with the following payload

    {
        "authToken": "<the Authentication Token>",
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "token": "<GCM Token; see discussion above>"
    }

If successful, the server returns this HTTP/200 response:

    {
        "profileId": "<the user's Profile Id>",
        "sessionId": "<a Session Id>",
        "xmppToken": "<an XMPP Token>"
    }

###Issuing authenticated HTTP requests
By now you should have a Session Id (either from creating a new account, signing in with an email, or creating a session from an Authentication Token).
To issue an authenticated HTTP request, add the HTTP header

    Authorization: Grindr3 <Session Id>

That is, take the literal string "Grindr3 " and append the Session Id.
That's your `Authorization` header.

#Account management

##Update the user's public profile
Issue an authenticated PUT to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/profile` with payload like this:

    {
        "aboutMe": "",
        "age": 18,
        "bodyType": 0,
        "displayName": "",
        "ethnicity": 0,
        "grindrTribes": [],
        "height": -1.0,
        "lookingFor": [],
        "relationshipStatus": 0,
        "showAge": false,
        "showDistance": false,
        "socialNetworks": {
            "facebook": {
                "userId": ""
            },
            "instagram": {
                "userId": ""
            },
            "twitter": {
                "userId": ""
            }
        },
        "weight": -1.0
    }

`bodyType`, `ethnicity`, `grindrTribes`, `lookingFor`, and `relationshipStatus` are managed fields, as described above.
`height` is a number of centimeters, or `-1.0` to hide it entirely.
`weight` is a number of grams, or `-1.0` to hide it entirely. 

If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an empty JSON object.

##Query user preferences
Issue an authenticated GET to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/prefs`.  Example response:

    {
        "chatPix": {
            "<hash of image>": {
                "mediaHash": "<hash of image>",
                "timestamp": <integer of unix milliseconds>
            }
        },
        "filters": {},
        "phrases": {},
        "quickyChatPixHash": null,
        "quickyPhraseId": null,
        "settings": {
            "unitSystem": 1
        }
    }

Note that the image hash is indeed repeated for some reason.

unitSystem 1 is USA Imperial units.

##Change user password
Issue an authenticated POST to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/users/update-password` with the payload:

    {
        "newPassword": "my c00l pa$$word",
        "oldPassword": "my cool password"
    }

If successful, the server response with HTTP/200 and a new Authentication Token and session:

    {
        "authToken": "<the Authentication Token>",
        "profileId": "<the Profile Id>",
        "sessionId": "<a Session Id for immediate use>",
        "xmppToken": "<an XMPP Token for immediate use>"
    }

Replace the Authentication Token you'd saved earlier with the new one.
Start using the new Session Id in future authenticated HTTP requests.

##Delete the account
To remove the account from the current device, just securely erase the Authentication Token and any other state you've accumulated.

You can optionally also delete the account *from the server*.
The user will lose all his preferences and will not be able to sign in on any device.

Issue an authenticated DELETE to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/profile` with no payload.
If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an empty JSON object.
The account is gone.

#Interacting with other users

##Get messages that were sent while you were logged official
Issue an authenticated POST to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/chat/messages?undelivered=true` with no payload. 
(Not an empty JSON object -- the Content-Length should be 0 and the Content-Type is absent.)

If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an object containing an array of offline messages:

    {
        "messages": []
    }

_TODO: Get some actual messages to make the example more useful._

##See nearby users
Issue an authenticated GET to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/locations/<Geohash>/profiles` with no payload.
You can optionally add query parameters.
These are known:

    online=false
    photoOnly=false
    favorite=false
    pageNumber=1

The Geohash appears to just be the hashing algorithm described at `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash`.

Example:

    https://grindr.mobi/v3/locations/hcx6g89bqfx7/online=false&photoOnly=false&favorite=false&pageNumber=1

If successful, the server responds wtih HTTP/200 and the following array:

    {
        "profiles": [
            {
                "age": null,
                "displayName": "hello world",
                "distance": null,
                "isFavorite": false,
                "profileId": "<his Profile Id>",
                "profileImageMediaHash": "<his Profile image hash>",
                "seen": <integer of unix timestamp in milliseconds>,
                "showAge": false,
                "showDistance": false
            },
            {
                "age": 28,
                "displayName": null,
                "distance": 1504.691430981795,
                "isFavorite": false,
                "profileId": "<his Profile Id>",
                "profileImageMediaHash": null,
                "seen": <integer of unix timestamp in milliseconds>,
                "showAge": true,
                "showDistance": true
            },
        ]
    }

The Profile image hash can be dropped into either of these CDN URLs:
    http://cdns.grindr.com/images/profile/1024x1024/<his Profile image hash>
    http://cdns.grindr.com/images/thumb/320x320/<his Profile image hash>

Note that the thumbnail size was increased between v2 (187px) and v3 (320px), and the URL has changed correspondingly.

##Add a user to your favorites (add a star)
Issue an authenticated POST to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/favorites/<his profile id>` with no payload.
(Not an empty JSON object -- the Content-Length should be 0 and the Content-Type is absent.)
If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an empty JSON object.

##Remove a user from your favorites (remove a star)
Issue an authenticated DELETE to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/favorites/<his profile id>` with no payload.
(Not an empty JSON object -- the Content-Length should be 0 and the Content-Type is absent.)
If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an empty JSON object.

##See who's blocking you and who you've blocked
Issue an authenticated GET request to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/blocks` with no payload.

If successful, the server response with HTTP/200 and this payload:

    {
        "blockedBy": [
            "<his Profile Id>",
            "<another Profile Id>"
        ],
        "blocking": [
            "<his Profile ID>"
        ]
    }

In the example above, 2 users have blocked you, and you are blocking 1 user.

##Block a user
Issue an authenticated POST to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/blocks/<his profile id>` with no payload.
(Not an empty JSON object -- the Content-Length should be 0 and the Content-Type is absent.)
If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an empty JSON object.

##Unblock all blocked users
Issue an authenticated DELETE to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/blocks`.
If successful, server response HTTP/200 with an empty JSON object.

##Acknowledging chats
After receiving a message from the XMPP server, the official client acknowledges the message by sending an authenticated PUT request to `https://grindr.mobi/v3/me/chat/messages?confirmed=true` with the following payload:

    {
        "messageIds": [
            "<UUID message id>",
            "<UUID message id>"
        ]
    }

If successful, the server responds with HTTP/200 and an empty JSON object.
